<h2 class="ind3">Personal Growth & Teaching Yoga</h2>

<p>Yoga is a process for learning about ourselves and opening to our fullest potential. It helps us to expand our awareness and transform our lives in ways that make us happier, healthier and feeling more whole within ourselves and in our relationships with others in the world. Embracing these basic values is the starting point for becoming a good yoga teacher.</p>

<p>Participants in this program invariably experience a deep and lasting sense of personal transformation as all of the elements of yoga become clearer and better integrated as you explore every aspect of yoga in your personal practice. In contrast to teacher training programs that emphasize attainment, competition or mastery, in this program we look to explore, refine, deepen, expand and learn without end. The primary source of this transformative learning is one's personal practice, and it is in the practice of yoga that we gain the most insight into how best to share the practice with others. Because yoga is a process for self-transformation, there is nothing to master, no end to what we can learn and no limit to how much we can grow and share.</p>

<h2 class="ind3">Developing Best Practices</h2>

<p>While yoga practice is the key to developing as a teacher, the Yoga Teacher Training & Certification Program methodically prepares you to teach with creativity, confidence, and competence. Rather than focusing narrowly on a single style or lineage, it is designed to give you the skills and knowledge to continuously evolve as a teacher based on your own evolution, interests, and intentions.</p>

<p>In contrast to quick immersion trainings and “mastery” programs, this program is designed to ensure that you develop and integrate a comprehensive foundation and set of skills into the fabric of your life so that you flourish as an informed practitioner and creative teacher of yoga for the rest of your life. This takes time, effort and commitment. Starting from wherever you are in your knowledge, skills and experience, this program will give you the opportunity to progressively develop into the best yoga teacher you can be.</p>

<p>Over 1,100 yoga teachers have participated in my yoga teacher training workshops over the past 17 years. They have gone on to teach in a variety of styles, including Vinyasa Flow, Anusara, Iyengar, Bikram, Ashtanga Vinyasa, Restorative & Therapeutic Yoga, Power Yoga, Yin, Pre/Post-Natal, Kids Yoga and others.</p>
